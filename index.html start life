  <h1>The start of Messi's life</h1>
  <p>Messi was born in Rosario, Argentina, on June 24, 1987. When Messi was younger, 
he used to play soccer with his friends and his two older siblings, so he wasn't afraid of the older boys. 
At eight years old, he signed up to join the Rosario youth system's Newell's Old Boys club. Messi didn't 
take to soccer until he started playing it in the streets at the age of four with his father and brothers. 
Messi has one sister and two brothers. Messi's siblings are Rodrigo Messi, Matias Messi, and Maria Sol Messi. 
Jorge Horacio Messi is his father, and Celia Maria Cuccittini is his mother. At a very young age, he began playing 
football with his older brothers and relatives, and it soon became his passion. When he was four years old, he joined the Grandoli club. 
Before he joined Newell's Old Boys Club a few years later, he had scored close to 500 goals. Messi was motivated to play soccer by his granny.
Lionel Messi grew up to become the best footballer in the world. He began participating in the youth activities at his 
preferred Newell's Old Boys in 1994. He played in 176 games over his six years there, scoring 234 goals, an incredible 
average for a child his age per game. </p>
